As always, run in Firefox. I can't get my projects to work in Chrome based browsers for some reason.

I couldn't get the sound files to stop without the stop buttons. So, you'll have to use those when you want to stop the music.
Everything else is working as intended.

All sound files are included. That's all. Thanks.
